- This repository contains all of my solutions for coding problems from various platforms: AtCoder, DMOJ, CSES, and more to come!
# Profiles
Feel free to check out my profile across various platforms:
- https://clist.by/coder/Spot/
# DMOJ Solutions
- To look at any problem on the DMOJ website, copy & paste https://dmoj.ca/problem/ to your browser, then add my solution's file name in the URL. For example, if my solution file name is "attraction.cpp", the URL to access the problem will be https://dmoj.ca/problem/attraction.
# CSES Solutions
- Similar to DMOJ, the URL to access the problem is https://cses.fi/problemset/task/NUMBER, where you replace NUMBER with my solution's file name.
